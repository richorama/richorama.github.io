Hi, my name is Richard Astbury, I work at Microsoft helping developers to succeed using the Azure cloud and AI. I'm a [Puralsight author](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/microsoft-orleans-introduction) and an ex Microsoft MVP.

I'm interested in programming in TypeScript, C#, Python and playing around with many more. In real life I like cycling, bass guitar, paddle boarding and jazz. I don't like marmite.

I live in Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK.

summary: A compilation of the books I have listened to or read in 2023. I started listening to audiobooks while doing household tasks and during commutes. The standout book for the author was 'Shoe Dog' by Phil Knight, the story of the founding of Nike, which received a five-star rating.

In the middle of 2023 I was left at home for a week while my wife and kids went abroad. I was left with a list of DIY tasks, so I decided listen to some audiobooks while glossing the hall stairs and landing.

Since then I have been cramming audiobooks into dog walks, car journeys and household tasks.

These are the titles I listened to in 2023 (a couple of physical books too). I have rated them out of 5 stars.

For me the stand out was "Shoe Dog", Phil Knights account of the founding of Nike. I was gripped from start to finish. He's a great story teller, and it's a fascinating story, making you wonder how Nike ever made it. I gave it 5 stars.
